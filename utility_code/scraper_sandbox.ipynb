      "            \"Return\": \"Just a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Naci\\u00f3n reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.[409] On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team's upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[410] On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1\\u20130 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.[411]\\n\\nOn 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000.[412][413] On 5 May, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers.[414] Argentina's place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3\\u20131 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001.[415] Messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay's Luis Su\\u00e1rez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hern\\u00e1n Crespo.[415]\\n\"\n",
